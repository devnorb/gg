# alright so yall think ive left for being exposed by xgladius and for faking unc:
answer: no.

i'm done with this community because well every fucking time i try to do something theres just that one fucking retard shitting on me like why don't you do a better job huh
the fucking unc test was not meant to be permanent; as a fucking placeholder until nexus gets the c functions down
ive never denied the hardcoding allegations (nexus saying i did), i did hardcode some (you can see for yourself in the file attached -> )
i literally have comments in the code stating i hardcoded 
the console shit being a empty function was because i thought nexus was not going to add those as well clearly you know the reason.
this is not my fault; this is because of nexus42 not adding much functions into macsploit. like if you did add those; i wouldn't have to make it right?
you will see me sometimes in hydrogen, but never in macsploit anymore.
the script was not made for security in mind; europa / kxr / ludi don't bother me with some hook shit thanks
sha384 part was messy; cause it was taken from egor skriptinoff's repo -> view it here: https://github.com/Egor-Skriptunoff/pure_lua_SHA
i tried my best alright? xgladius you have literally more fucking experience than any of us in the server god

- norb out.
